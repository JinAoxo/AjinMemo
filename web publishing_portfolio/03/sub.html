                                When the world is crumbling under the relentless pulse of the Signal Tower, Mono takes refuge wherever he can.
                                    His thin paper mask is a comfort to forget that the outside world hates him and wants him to fail, but he cannot hide forever.<br>

                                    He wears a coat and a bread bag with a hole in his head. The bag he is wearing can be used by picking up a hat and others off the map. However, I still can't see well. But in the course of fighting a dry man, the bag of bread is taken off. From this point on, the player will not be allowed to put a hat on Mono.

                                    For the first time in the Little Nightmare series, she has a unique superpower from the beginning of the main film. Official settings suggest he was also an important figure at the Signal Tower.

In the Little Nightmare World Pavilion, adults are usually seen as villains and children as good, while these are clearly villains, even though they are shaped like children, as shown in the above description. Given that he is close to a doll, not a human being, and that he lives by some kind of magic, it is assumed that someone made a doll that lives with bad intentions.

Patients who have been treated by doctors are not complete human beings, but strange creatures (?) created by combining human body parts, mannequins' arms and legs, and other hooks. If you look closely, the cross section of the cut body is realistic, and the body and other parts that appear to be dead are still visible, indicating that they are not mannequins but modified bodies.

                                    He is the main follower of the hospital map. It is quite a creepy impression because it has pale skin and eyes behind it, and its gums are also exposed, and it has a lot of fat on its back, especially because of its considerable obesity like the guests in the previous work. When you see a giant caterpillar crawling in a game where even the clothes get too tight, it feels like a giant caterpillar is crawling. Unusually, the chin is quite small for the head, hanging from the ceiling. Every time I move, something like powder keeps falling from the ceiling of the hospital. While hanging from the ceiling, he also crawls down to the limited floor of the chase.

They are really crazy about TV, so they watch TV in the bathroom, and sometimes they bang their heads on TV, and sometimes fall off trying to watch TV on the other side. The TV viewers are watching has bright melodies, but only white noise appears on the screen. However, since the description refers to fantastic colors and shapes, it seems that something is not visible from the child's perspective but only from the adult's perspective.

It was presumed to be the final boss, perhaps because the illustration of the original work seemed to have been described in a large way in the center as a man with a fairly thin, pale face and a suit, as its name suggests. You can't see your face well in the game, but you look old when you look at the model. He is also relatively normal, quiet and quiet compared to other pursuers, teleporting and chasing for a short distance. Paintings of a black man wearing a hat that seems to describe him are found in many places.

                        <span>The Wildness</span>
                        <p>As the first chapter of the main work, the main pursuer is a hunter. It's not inside the city, it's outside. Instead of having no tutorial chapters, the early part of this chapter serves as a tutorial. Therefore, there are many parts that seem to have egotized the prison chapter of the previous work.</p>

                        <p>The first place to enter after arriving in the city by door crossing the sea. Teachers and bullies appear as main enemies. It is also the first chapter where you can attack the enemy by swinging your own weapon after dodging every time.</p>

                        <span>The Hospital</span>
                        <p>A place where doctors and patients appear. Given that the hospital chapter has the darkest sections, it seems to imply the situation inside the hospital. It is divided into the upper and lower floors, with patients appearing on the upper floors and doctors appearing on the lower floors. Although it is simply described as a hospital, the hidden room with bodies in the bathtub is surrounded by soft cushions that are commonly found in mental hospitals, and the atmosphere of an old-fashioned mental hospital is excercised by electric chairs used for electrical treatment or iron gates that are only seen in prisons. </p>

                        <span>The Pale City</span>
                        <p>A downtown area where the black tower is located, featuring viewers and skinny men. When you first enter the city, you can see something falling from afar, and it is highly likely that you are a viewer based on the situation such as sound and shape. Viewers who were looking at the black tower from the railing on the roof of the building during the process can see themselves stepping on their feet and falling down.
